\chapter{Markov Chains}
In the section we will introduce the model of a classical markov chain with
discrete time for which each state belongs to some finite or contouble set of
possible state. In the next section we extend the definition to states with a
continuous states or in general a continuous density function.
\section{Background}
\section{Countable States Markov Chains}
Let $\left( X_t \right)_{t\in\N}$ a sequence of random variables. Let us
assume that each instant $t\in\N$ the variable $X_t$ takes values in a countable state space $S$. 
\begin{defn}[Markov Property]
The sequence $(X_t)_{t\in\N}$ satisfies the Markov property if for each time
$t$ and for each states $s,s_0,\dots,s_n\in S$
\begin{equation}
  \Ph(X_{n+1}=s\,\vert\,
  X_0=s_0,\dots,X_n=s_n)=\Ph(X_{n+1}=s\,\vert\, X_n=s_n).
  \label{eq:markov-property}
\end{equation}
That is, the state assumed at a certain instant $t$ only depends on the
previous state and not on the all history.
\end{defn}

Observe that, since we are assuming that $S$ is finite, then we are assuming
that there exists an enumeration $S=\left\{ s_1,\dots,s_n,\dots \right\}$.
Hence,  for the sake of simplicity, and without loss of generality, we can
assume that $S=\N$, from which $X_t\in\N$ for each $t$.
